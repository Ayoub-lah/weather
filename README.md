# Weather Web Application

## Overview
This is a simple and responsive web application that provides real-time weather information for any city around the world. The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it in a clean and user-friendly interface. Users can search for a city, and the app will display the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather.

## Features
- **Search by City**: Users can enter the name of any city to get the current weather information.
- **Real-Time Data**: The app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Responsive Design**: The web app is designed to be responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Weather Details**: Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief weather description.
- **Dynamic Weather Icons**: Shows weather icons corresponding to the current weather conditions.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **API**: OpenWeatherMap API
- **Fonts**: Google Fonts (Open Sans, Poppins)
- **Icons**: SVG icons for the search button

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-web-app.git
cd weather-web-app
```

### Set Up API Key:
- Sign up for a free API key from OpenWeatherMap.
- Replace the `apiKey` value in the `script.js` file with your own API key:

```javascript
let weather = {
    apiKey: "558b591bed5b2d26024b0e16d4f7a8a3",
    // Rest of the code...
};
```

### Run the Application:
- Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
- Alternatively, you can use a local server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code) to run the app.

### Search for a City:
- Enter the name of a city in the search bar and click the search button to view the weather details.

## Code Explanation

### HTML (`index.html`)
- The HTML file contains the structure of the weather app, including the search bar, weather details, and placeholders for dynamic content.
- It uses Google Fonts for typography and includes an SVG icon for the search button.

### CSS (`style.css`)
- The CSS file styles the app, making it visually appealing and responsive.
- It includes styles for the card layout, search bar, buttons, and weather details.

### JavaScript (`script.js`)
- The JavaScript file handles the logic for fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- It dynamically updates the DOM with the fetched weather data (city name, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description).
- It also includes an event listener for the search button to trigger the API call.

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: The user enters a city name in the search bar and clicks the search button.
2. **API Call**: The app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the city name and API key.
3. **Data Fetching**: The API returns weather data in JSON format.
4. **Display Data**: The app parses the JSON data and updates the DOM with the relevant weather information.
